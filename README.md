# SPPU-FE-19-pattern-Practicals

This repository contains all the practicals I had performed during my First Year of Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree.


## 1.PPS (Programming and Problem Solving)

I have tried to solve all the problems using Python Language.
All the program files are named after the subject name and the sequence of problem statements. 

You can see all the problem statements [here](https://github.com/inamdarketan/SPPU-FE-19-pattern-Practicals/blob/main/Problem%20Statements.txt).



Happy Learning !!! :smiley:
